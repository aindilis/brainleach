Here are some design docs.

Brainleach  records session  commands.  It  keeps a  basic, expandable
todo list.  There is a current task context which consists of a set of
goals  that are  achieved  by  a given  action.   There are  checklist
lookups  and automated  assistance.  The  computer can  take  over the
completion  of more  complex  tasks.   So, in  this  way, scripts  are
automatically developed for various tasks and added to a library.

The Task is  an HTN.  Each checklist consists of a  set of steps, each
of which is  necessary in that a later step requires  it, and the last
step is sufficient.
